Build History:
==============

3/29:
Added more tests and additional screen logging.
It now has milliseconds in processing time.
The time of each log entry is on the left.
Time on the log entries now has milliseconds.
The output is better formatted.
Pass /Silent after the file name and suppress all output except for the intro/starting text.
The initial screen says to press control-c to end processing and there is second delay after that.  This text does not suppress.
I can easily change around the log format more easily.
It does not log to file, but you can redirect to a text file if needed.  Redirecting to a file is going to be much more preferred over the code writing to a file because it would require some thread sync code which would slow things down a little – cannot have lots of threads writing to the same file at one time via code without running into issues. Redirection to a file of stuff always printed to the screen should work around those limitations. 


3/29
fixed formatting of screen logging to make it look more even visually
test numbers were one off - caused by bug introduced when the ability to handle a header line in the config was added
Now supports sending of very, very basic email. See "SendEmail".
Now supports 4 parameters
SearchInbox now has the abilty to only return item ids instead of always returning many properties including the message body.
Made the ReadMe file format a little easier to read.
Added /LogAsCSV switch.
ItemsSearch on the Categories field was changed to ItemClass. 
Cleaned-up some of the text in the logging.

4/2
Command-line parameters are now case-insensitive
Added abiltiy to log CSV to a filename
Pressing X ends processing rather than the user needing to press control-c
Fixed issues with CSV headers. Verified loading of CSV into Excel.

4/24/2013
Cleaned-up readme file. 
Release of 1.0
 
5/13/2013
Started on 1.1 version
Now works with Exchange 2013 and 2010_SP2 schema - If statments were missing.

5/17/2013
The connection limit was at default (2 per site), I increased this to 65000. 
The reason for doing this is that this tool should not have its own restrictions.

Added, but not yet tested:
    Added code to do Impersonation only
    Added code to pick directURl, Do autodiscover, do autodisocver processe but don't do the SCP lookups.
    Added a test to do autodiscover testing only.  This will create a session object per thread.
	Still in progress..  Do not use app until tested.
 
9/10/2013
Started version 1.2
Added /TrustAllCerts paramater to suppress basic certificate checks.  This will make all certificates trusted.
NOTE:  Need to rework command line parameters so that each parameter will be serached for in the arguments.  This is 
  needed since the number of parameters being passed and their optional presense is getting too complex to handle
  by just if statements.
A problem pulling the source was brought to my attention.  I fixed the code check-in issue.  You should now be able to pull the full source.


==============
Planed:
==============

	Test all changes since 5/17/2013

	Finish work on TrustAllCerts

	Add ability to resolve a specified number of recipients.

	Add a search on random key words and retrieve the first n results.  n is specified in the config file.  If not specified it should 
	return a random max number of entries between 100 and 500.

	Add the ability to do random searches of the calendar with dates between now and 3 months.

	Need to rework command line parameters so that each parameter will be serached for in the arguments.  This is needed since the number of 
	parameters being passed and their optional presense is getting too complex to handle by just if statements.

	Release 1.2
